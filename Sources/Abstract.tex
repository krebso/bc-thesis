\chapter*{Abstract}

Our objective is to generate explanations to help understand prostate cancer presence predictions in a reasonable time.
We examine several popular explainability methods producing visually similar results to the current, notably slow solution based on Occlusion.
To ensure the suitability of our candidate methods, we carefully establish exhaustive quantitative and qualitative benchmarks.
Our examined methods achieve $2$ orders of magnitude faster computation time and $50$ times better GPU utilization without sacrificing faithfulness or localization capabilities.
Moreover, a domain expert deems two methods viable alternatives.
With all auxiliary pipeline processing, methods selected as suitable allow us to generate explanations for the utilized dataset in approximately $9$ hours, compared to the $3.3$ days needed using Occlusion.
