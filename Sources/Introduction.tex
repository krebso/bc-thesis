\chapter{Introduction}\label{chap:introduction}

Neural networks are on a verge to be employed in medical care. In order to aid doctors in practice, we need to be able to reason behind networks decisions.

This thesis aims to shed light on which methods are suitable for such reasoning. We divide the text into four chapters. In the first, we briefly present field of digital histopathology and deep learning, with focus on convolutional neural networks. In the second chapter, we describe the domain of prostate cancer detection and how RationAI team helps pathologists to detect cancerous tissue with their model. In the third chapter, we dive into theory behind explaining deep neural networks -- we overview several methods, which could help us achieve our goal of performant explantion generation. In the last chapter, we present quantitative and qualitative evaluation strategy and we evaluate presented methods.

We propose a few technical remarks about current implementation of production pipeline, which will further accelerate the process of generating explanation heatmaps.
