\chapter{Introduction}\label{chap:introduction}

CNN's are successful part of Digital Histopathology. In order to aid histopathologists in practice, we need to be able to reason behind networks decision.

This thesis aims to shed light on which methods are suitable for such reasoning. We divide the text into four chapters. In the first, we briefly present field of digital histopathology and a role of deep learning. In the second chapter, we describe settings of RationAI team in the domain of prostate cancer detection. We inspect used model, dataset and training. In the third chapter, we dive into theory behind explaining deep neural networks. In the last chapter, we present evaluation strategy alongside with the results and winning method.

We propose a few technical remarks about current implementation of production pipeline, which will further accelerate the process of generating explanation heat-maps.
