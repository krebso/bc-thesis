This project addresses questions concerning the process of migrating from FIPS 140-2 to FIPS 140-3.  The transition process includes organizational, documentation and procedural changes necessary to update and efficiently manage the ever increasing list of security products that are tested for use in the US and Canadian governments.  Changes also support the migration of internally developed security standards towards a set of standards developed and maintained by an international body, while also referencing government standards.  The transition of FIPS 140-3 has begun  On March 22, 2019, the Secretary of Commerce approved Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS) 140-3, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules, which supersedes FIPS 140-2.
