\chapter*{Abstract}

Our goal is to generate explanations that help understand prostate cancer presence predictions in a reasonable time.
We review several popular explainability methods that produce visually similar results to the current, notably slow solution based on Occlusion.
To ensure the suitability of our candidate methods, we carefully establish exhaustive quantitative and qualitative benchmarks.
Our evaluated methods achieve $2$ orders of magnitude faster computation time and $50$ times better GPU utilization without sacrificing faithfulness or localization capabilities.
Furthermore, a domain expert considers two methods as viable alternatives.
With all auxiliary pipeline processing, the methods selected as suitable allow us to generate explanations for the used dataset in about $2$ hours, compared to the $3.3$ days needed using Occlusion.
